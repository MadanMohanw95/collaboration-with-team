Creating User Stories:
====================
I follow a structured approach to creating user stories. I start by gathering requirements through stakeholder interviews, workshops, and analyzing healthcare documentation. I then break these requirements into smaller, manageable user stories.

Each user story follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]." For example, "As a nurse, I want to access patient records quickly so that I can provide timely care." This ensures clarity and focus on the user's perspective. I also include acceptance criteria to define when the story is complete, helping the development team understand the scope.

Additionally, I define testing scenarios within the acceptance criteria to ensure Development and QA consider all scenarios. By providing detailed information, I make sure the user story is successful.

For larger projects, I create EPICs, which are high-level user stories that capture broad requirements. EPICs are broken down into smaller user stories for incremental development and testing.

I prioritize user stories based on business value, urgency, and healthcare regulations, and continuously refine them through feedback and collaboration with stakeholders and the development team. This iterative process helps deliver a product that aligns with user needs and healthcare goals.


Agile Product Owner/Business Analyst:
==========================
In my role as an Agile Product Owner/Business Analyst, I host kickoff meetings with the development and QA teams, as well as the manager, to present user stories and address any queries they may have. 
I attend daily standups to answer additional questions that arise during the development phase. I also participate in meetings for incremental demos to review progress and gather feedback. 

After development is complete, I collaborate with the QA team to test the features thoroughly. Once a feature is completed, I attend retrospectives to discuss what went well, what didn't, and how we can improve moving forward.

Additionally, I regularly collaborate with clients and stakeholders to understand their priorities and preferences, and I present features after they are deployed to QA environments to ensure alignment with their expectations.
I maintain the product backlog, ensuring it is up-to-date and reflects the current priorities and requirements. 

I facilitate communication between the development team and stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned on the project goals and progress. By continuously refining user stories and acceptance criteria based on feedback, I help ensure that the final product meets the users' needs and business objectives.


SAFe experience:
================
I have extensive experience in the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), I have been deeply involved in gathering and analyzing requirements, designing features, and creating detailed user stories with acceptance criteria. I actively participated in Program Increment (PI) planning sessions to align multiple Agile teams on objectives and prioritize features. 

During sprints, I collaborated closely with developers and the QA team to address questions, define testing scenarios, and ensure thorough testing of features. I attended incremental demos to review progress and gather feedback, and participated in retrospectives to discuss improvements. 

To measure success and ensure continuous improvement, I used various metrics and measures, including:

Velocity: Tracking the team's capacity to deliver work within a sprint.
Burn-down Charts: Monitoring progress towards sprint goals.
Cycle Time: Measuring the time taken to complete a user story from start to finish.
Defect Density: Tracking the number of defects found during testing to ensure quality.
Customer Satisfaction: Gathering feedback from stakeholders and end-users to assess the effectiveness of delivered features.
